Here's an AngularJS app for a mobile app store:

In the controller MainController.js, there are three objects $scope.move, $scope.shutterbugg, and $scope.gameboard that each contain info about an app, like its title and price.
In the view index.html in the .main section, each app is displayed inside a .card div.
But looking at the view, the same code is written over and over again to display each app. This is repetitive and error-prone. Let's fix this.
Instructions
1.
In the new file js/directives/appInfo.js, type in this code:

app.directive('appInfo', function() { 
  return { 
    restrict: 'E', 
    scope: { 
      info: '=' 
    }, 
    templateUrl: 'js/directives/appInfo.html' 
  }; 
});
2.
Include this new JavaScript file in index.html in line 48 as a <script> element.
3.
In the new file js/directives/appInfo.html. Type in this HTML to display an app's info:

<img class="icon" ng-src="{{ info.icon }}"> 
<h2 class="title">{{ info.title }}</h2> 
<p class="developer">{{ info.developer }}</p> 
<p class="price">{{ info.price | currency }}</p>
4.
In index.html, replace the contents of the first .card div with the new <app-info> element:

<div class="card"> 
  <app-info info="move"></app-info> 
</div>
5.
Do the same for the second and third .card divs. Replace their contents with <app-info info="shutterbugg"></app-info> and <app-info info="gameboard"></app-info>

View the AngularJS app in the browser by typing http://localhost:8000.
